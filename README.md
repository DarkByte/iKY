Ever been in an endless Hangouts / WebEx / Skype / you-name-it meeting? Ever cheated on it by resuming to code only to be brought back to reality by someone mentioning your name and asking you a question? Frantically looking for the un-mute button on the conference application view is not my idea of fun. iKY was born as a solution to this problem.

iKY is able to turn on/off the system microphone, thus ensuring "compatibility" with any (Mac OS X) VoIP app. The microphone can be toggled by:
* tapping the main window's image
* selecting the "Toggle microphone" option from the top bar menu
* using a system-wide custom keyboard shortcut.

Of course, as any companion worth its salt, iKY can be started along with OS X by simply using the checkbox from Preferences.

For downloading the latest version of iKY, check the "Releases" folder.
